                      It is expressly proclaimed that our organization does not
                      permit its agents to gather private information, such as
                      credit card information, from our clients. As a result, we
                      strongly warn our clients not to discuss personal or
                      sensitive information with our workers. If you do so, you
                      do it at your own risk, and our firm is not accountable
                      for any abuse.

                      We have a policy of employing aliases to ensure the
                      following:

                        <li>
                          We utilize pseudonyms to eliminate unnecessary
                          confusion and inconvenience for our clients when they
                          are allocated a new account manager; it allows our
                          customers to stay connected with a single point of
                          contact and comfortably recall their names.

                        <li>
                          Furthermore, because our workforce comprises people
                          from many areas and cultures, Using a pseudonym allows
                          us to exhibit a consistent organizational culture.
